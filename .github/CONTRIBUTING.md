<div align='center'>

Thank you for being interested in contributing to this project. We need the extra help!

Firstly, please note that the project is still under active development. There is a few contributors and we don't always have time to keep this as up to date as they should be. You are probably going to find inacuracies and proberbly bugs here and there. Sorry in advance.

> This file will be updated soon enough. For now, please follow along with the guide in the [readme](../README.md) to get the program up and running. It's shouldn't be too hard figuring out what is what as long as you know both Go and TS.
